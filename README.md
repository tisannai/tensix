# Tensix

## Introduction

Tensix is a collection of basic C-libraries that provide an
environment for convenient programming and efficient programs. Tensix
is top level for a collection of core libraries.

The core libraries may exist individually, but Tensix also collects
them into one monolithic library. However, the header are separate,
but there is "tensix.h" which references all of them.

Tensix core libraries:

1. Alogir: Algorithm collection for containers.
1. Arenas: Arena based memory allocator for mid-lifetime objects.
1. Bitumi: Bit-packer.
1. Chainy: Singly Linked List library.
1. Comlin: Command line option parsing.
1. Framer: Unrolled Doubly Linked List library.
1. Gromer: Autoresized pointer container.
1. Litter: Collection of miscellaneous stuff.
1. Logger: Flexible logger library. String based log groups with full
           control.
1. Mapper: Hash table.
1. Memtun: Proxy for memory management.
1. Ringer: Ring buffer for pointers.
1. Segman: Memory pooler for fixed size slots.
1. Sixten: Support for Tensix.
1. Slinky: Simple string library for efficient and well integrated
           string management.
